# BF-Pizza
Collaborative Repository for the Beacon Falls Pizza Palace Website

## Mission
The purpose of this website redisign is to create a simple and precise page accesible on both desktop and mobile devices. It must serve as a hub to browse the menu and learn about the services offered by the local resturant

## Design
Many people never leave the main page on websites. That's why you put all of the info on one page. This type of design also greatly reduces load times and simplifies searches. A scrolling section based philiopsy will be implmented for this website. Photos will make up a majority of the UI.
